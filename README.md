  Lopt is a multi-modal deepfake classification framework leveraging transformer-based architectures for high-confidence media authentication. It integrates ViT and TimeSformer models for  classifications, optimized via stratified training, augmentation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Built for real-world robustness, Lopt supports scalable inference through a FastAPI backend and offers a React-powered UI for streamlined interaction.

## What Are Deepfakes — and Why Should You Care?

Deepfakes are AI-generated media — often hyper-realistic videos or images — where a person’s face, voice, or identity is altered or replaced with another. Initially a byproduct of generative research (e.g., GANs and diffusion models), deepfakes have rapidly evolved from novelty to existential threat.

> 📉 Implications: Misinformation, digital harassment, political manipulation, identity theft, and erosion of public trust.

As synthetic content becomes increasingly indistinguishable from authentic media, we need machine learning models that can see what humans no longer can.

## Meet Lopt

Lopt is a multimodal deepfake detection framework designed to analyze and classify images and videos as `Real` or `Fake`. It combines:

- **ViT-based** architectures for image classification

- **TimeSformer-based** models for video understanding

- Clean and reproducible pipelines for training, evaluation, and deployment

- Full-stack implementation for both research and real-world use

## Project Overview

This project implements two complementary models for deepfake detection:

1. **Virtus**: A Vision Transformer (ViT) based model for image-level deepfake detection with binary classification head.

   - `Base Model:` [facebook/deit-base-distilled-patch16-224](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877)
   - `Dataset:` [~190k labeled samples across real/fake images](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UksPJfRtgw_fLsGcpCRAEWSyt_5fSA9Y?usp=sharing)
   - `Results:`
     - Accuracy: 99.20%
     - Macro F1 Score: 0.9920
     - Evaluated using classification reports and confusion matrix
   - Inference Ready: Deployed to Hugging Face 🤗 [agasta/virtus](https://huggingface.co/agasta/virtus)

2. **Scarlet**: A TimeSformer-based architecture for video-level deepfake analysis with memory-efficient Temporal attention mechanism.

- `Base Model:` [facebook/timesformer-base-finetuned-k400](https://huggingface.co/facebook/timesformer-base-finetuned-k400)
- `Dataset:` [FaceForensics++](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics)
- `Results:` - Accuracy: 96% - Macro F1 Score: 0.958 - Evaluated using classification reports and confusion matrix
- Inference Ready: Deployed to Hugging Face 🤗 [agasta/scarlet](https://huggingface.co/agasta/scarlet)

*<p align="center">Comparative evaluation of deepfake detection performance across modern and legacy models.</p>*

The framework is designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration of new models, datasets, evaluation metrics or with other projects.
You can load the model into your project using:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification, AutoFeatureExtractor

model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained("agasta/virtus")
extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained("agasta/virtus")
```

It also provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing media files. For full training code, dataset
preprocessing, and evaluation metrics, check the [Virtus model README](./models/image/README.md)
& [Scarlet model README](./models/video/README.md)

## Architecture

Lopt is structured as a modular ML system built for fast inference, responsive UX, and scalable deployment.
It integrates a RESTful backend, transformer-based inference engines, and a frontend interface — all wired together
via clean API boundaries.

### System Overview

![diagram-export-4-20-2025-5_07_55-AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86e074e3-8502-4866-8803-9580f4bd1ef8)

*<p align="center">Fullstack System Architecture</p>*


### Request Lifecycle:

1. **Media Upload (Frontend)**

   - Built with React and TailwindCSS, Users select or drag-and-drop an image or video
   - `Axios` sends a `POST` request to `/playground`endpoint with the media as multipart/form-data

2. **Backend Routing (FastAPI)**

   - FastAPI handles the `/playground` route asynchronously
   - Payload is validated and temporarily saved or streamed in-memory
   - Inference logic branches based on file MIME type (image/, video/)

3. **Model Inference Pipeline**

   - Transformer models are pre-loaded and cached using Hugging Face’s `AutoModelForImageClassification` or `AutoModelForVideoClassification`
   - Corresponding processors handle resizing, normalization, and tensor conversion (ViTImageProcessor)
   - Inputs are batched and pushed through the model with `torch.no_grad()` to ensure fast, memory-safe execution

4. **Output Generation**

   - Model logits are passed through softmax to generate class probabilities
   - Top predicted class is mapped back using `config.id2label`
   - Output is serialized into a response payload:

   ```json
   {
     "type": "image",
     "label": "Fake",
     "confidence": 0.9912
   }
   ```

5. **Frontend Display**
   - Response is parsed and rendered in the UI with color-coded tags and animation feedback
     > Future Note: will include saliency maps, Grad-CAM visualizations, and image overlays for transparency

### Model Caching Strategy:

- Models (Virtus, Scarlet) are loaded on server startup and held in-memory via Python singleton pattern, module scope
- Avoids repeated `from_pretrained()` calls, reducing cold start latency
- Torch is placed in `eval()` mode with disabled gradients for optimal performance
- Devices auto-detect (CPU/GPU) with planned support for `ONNX` and `TensorRT acceleration`
